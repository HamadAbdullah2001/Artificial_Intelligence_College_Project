# Tic Tac Toe Game (Artificial Intelligence College Project)

1. Description
    In this project you will write three interactive AI tutorials (Solving Problems by Searching, Adversarial Search and Constraint Satisfaction). You will write them as
    Jupyter notebooks which implement and explain some of the essential algorithms you have seen in class.
    The Jupyter notebook has to explain the algorithms and related concepts in both Arabic and English, and most importantly it has to explain how to implement the
    algorithms from scratch.
    
    The notebook should also contain at least one appropriate formulated problem for each notebook, to which the algorithms are applied, and, where applicable, their
    performance evaluated and compared. These problems should preferably be simplified problems from our background and daily interactions.
    You should guide the reader to test and change variables in the problem/algorithm so they can understand the important concepts.
    The following table contains the algorithms you need to explain, implement, and show their performance on the formulated problem.
